# <p align="center">Simple TicTacToe in the terminal</p>
![](https://github.com/alexanderchainsaw/demo_repo/blob/main/demo.gif)  
Simple tictactoe with score tracking and alphabet letters instead of a regular board
(for simplicity in selecting moves)  
Checking for game completion is done by slicing the board 
and converting each slice into a set(). If after conversion the length of a
slice == 1, the game is over
